EF Core is a modern object-database mapper for .NET. It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations. EF Core works with SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, SQLite, Azure Cosmos DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other databases through a provider plugin API.

Installation
EF Core is available on NuGet. Install the provider package corresponding to your target database. See the list of providers in the docs for additional databases.

Build from source
Most people use EF Core by installing pre-build NuGet packages, as shown above. Alternately, the code can be built and packages can be created directly on your development machine.
